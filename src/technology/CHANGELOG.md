## üìù `Jan 20th 2021` Reviews and Events

1) :star:Ô∏è Reviews
The ‚Äúreviews‚Äù functionality on breathecode has been upgrade to keep track of the comments and rating that the student left us on the specific review platform, its really important to keep track of this as it will be used to feed the website automatically. 

2) :date: Events Tags and Two-Way Sync ‚ô∫
The workshops and events continue to be one of the most important marketing activities, so far we have been importing the events from eventbrite and displaying them on the website.

Now, events will also be exported into eventbrite. We ask the marketing team to create the events on breathecode and then finish publishing them on eventbrite. Why is this important? Because we you have to start tagging the events on breathecode, tagging the events will allow us to better catalog the incoming leads based on those tags. In the near future you will be able to send campaigns to specific tags , for example: Send an email to all people that attended events related to python.
